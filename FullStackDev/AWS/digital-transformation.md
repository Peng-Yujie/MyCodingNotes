# Digital Transformation

## Key concepts

- **Digital Transformation**: The process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. This reimagining of business in the digital age is digital transformation.
- **Burning Platform**: A burning platform is a metaphor for a situation where a company must either embrace digital transformation or face the consequences of being left behind.
- **Computing Power**: The throughput measured at which a computer completes tasks. It is measured in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second).
